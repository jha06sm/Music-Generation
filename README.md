Music-Generation is a Python project that generates music by algorithmically creating audio waveforms and exporting them as .wav files. It demonstrates how mathematical functions and digital signal processing concepts can be used to synthesize sound and compose simple musical sequences programmatically.

The project is lightweight, easy to set up, and serves as a foundation for:

Exploring the basics of sound synthesis (sine, square, and other waveforms)

Experimenting with rhythm, notes, and procedural composition

Understanding how to write audio data into standard file formats

Extending towards AI/ML-based generative music systems

This makes it both an educational project for beginners in DSP/music programming and a creative tool for generating unique musical patterns through code.
